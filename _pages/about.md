# Research Interests

I am deeply interested in automated bug/vulnerability finding techniques such as fuzzing.
This is because I believe it is crucial to automatically detect unintended bugs in software or hardware before they can be exploited by malicious attackers.
By ensuring that a system behaves exactly as its developer intended, we can build a safer and more trustworthy digital world.

I am also fascinated by computer systems and high-performance computer architecture design. I find great fulfillment in designing systems that can serve as catalysts for solving humanity’s unsolved problems and for creating a better world through technological innovation.

Finally, I have recently become highly interested in AI security, monitoring, and privacy.
While many big tech companies are focusing heavily on improving AI performance, I think there has been insufficient attention to the side effects and security risks that accompany such rapid development.
Among these, AI security could pose a serious threat to humanity in the near future.
Therefore, I aim to contribute to the development and deployment of secure and responsible AI systems.
